### <span id="typeshelper-function">typesHelper Function: `typesHelper({data, types}, Boolean = false)`</span>
[(go to top)](#jamilservices-types-helper)   

The typesHelper function is designed to validate custom data against specified types. It provides a flexible and efficient way to ensure that data conforms to expected formats.

#### <span id="functionality">Functionality:</span>
[(go to top)](#jamilservices-types-helper)   

- **Adaptive Validation**: The function adjusts its validation approach based on the `types` parameter, accommodating both single and multiple type checks.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: If validation fails or if the input is invalid, it generates a comprehensive error detailing the issue.

#### <span id="input-parameters">Input Parameters:</span>
[(go to top)](#jamilservices-types-helper)   

- **{data, types} (Object)**: An object containing the data and types for validation.
  - **data (any)**: The custom data to be validated.
  - **types (Array.<string|string)**: An array of strings or a single string specifying the type or types to validate the data against.
- **boolean (Boolean)**: A flag indicating whether the function should only return boolean values. When true, the function returns simple true or false; otherwise, it may return detailed error information.

#### <span id="returns">Returns:</span>
[(go to top)](#jamilservices-types-helper)   

**Success**: Returns true if the data matches the specified types.
Failure: Returns an error object detailing the nature of the type mismatch or other validation issues.

#### <span id="how-to-use">How to Use:</span>
[(go to top)](#jamilservices-types-helper)   

1. **Prepare Data and Types**: Create an object containing the `data` to validate and the `types` against which you wish to validate the data.
2. **Call the Function**: Invoke `typesHelper` with the prepared object and the boolean flag based on your preference for the response type.
3. **Interpret the Response**: Handle the response by checking if it's true (indicating successful validation) or by examining the error object for details on validation failures.
   
The `typesHelper` function is an essential utility for scenarios where robust and flexible data validation is required. Its intuitive design and detailed responses make it an indispensable tool for ensuring data integrity and adherence to expected formats.
